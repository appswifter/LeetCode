/**
 * 130. Surrounded Regions
 * 
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 * 
 * Example:
 *  X X X X
 *  X O O X
 *  X X O X
 *  X O X X
 *  
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 *  X X X X
 *  X X X X
 *  X X X X
 *  X O X X
 * 
 * Explanation:
 *  Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border 
 *  of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not 
 * connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if 
 * they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
 */

// First, check the four border of the matrix. If there is a element is
// 'O', alter it and all its neighbor 'O' elements to '1'.

// Then ,alter all the 'O' to 'X'

// At last,alter all the '1' to 'O'

// X X X X           X X X X             X X X X
// X X O X  ->       X X O X    ->       X X X X
// X O X X           X 1 X X             X O X X
// X O X X           X 1 X X             X O X X
